= Features =

<ul>

can now be toggled on/off as desired.
</li>

<li>Call Me Request widget - 
Feature for adding a Call Me request Widget to the sidebar on the public side of your WordPress installation. This allows Website
visitors to call you (using the RingCentral RingOut feature) and if no one is on-line to answer the request will be stored on the admin side.
</li>

provided (double opt-in) contact information: email and / or mobile.
</li>

<li>Manually add subscribers - 
Feature to manually add to your list of Newsletter announcement subscribers with name email and mobile number. The new subscriber
will still have to opt-in to the list.
</li>

<li>List / Manage subscribers - 
Feature to display your existing list of Newsletter announcement subscribers. You can delete individually or collectively.
There is no edit feature as changes will need to be initiated by the subscriber and re-validated via the opt-in process.
</li>

<li>List / Manage Call Me Requests -  
Feature to display your existing list of Call Me requests. You can delete individually or collectively. List shows caller
name, phone number to call back, and reason for the call.
</li>

<li>Default pages are created for you to customize -
Default WordPress pages are created upon activation of the plugin. A very basic confirmation email page is provided.
A basic page for confirming opt-out requests is also provided. Page names are: 'eMail Confirmation' & 'eMail Unsubscribe'.
NOTE: permainks must be set to "Post name"
</li>

<li>New Database tables are created - 
New tables are created in the database and seeded with basic starting data in order for the plugin to operate correctly.
All table names are prefixed by 'ringcentral_'. The plugin drops these tables if the plugin is ever deleted, so be sure
to save any data if you ever plan on deleting the plugin.
</li>
